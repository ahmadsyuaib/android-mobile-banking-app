# Proof-of-Concept - Validating mobile app security controls

This PoC tests whether recommended mobile app security controls can be implemented and if they can really help in stopping potential threats.

## Goals Checklist

- [ ] Build a working banking mobile app with decoupled components
- [ ] Perform threat modelling on each component
- [ ] Implement relevant mobile app security controls and validate their effectiveness
- [ ] Recommend practical mobile app security controls

# 🚀 Getting Started with the App (Expo + React Native)

This project uses **React Native** with **Expo** for rapid mobile development. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and run the app locally.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js (v18 or later recommended)**: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Git**: [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- **Expo CLI**: Install globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`
- **Expo Go App** on your phone:

  - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
  - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

> ⚠️ Only physical devices are supported with **Expo Go** (not emulators). If you want to run on Android Emulator, see below.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Add environmental variables

- Create a .env file and .env.production files and add relevant variables (e.g. Supabase url and key)

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

This will open a browser tab with the Expo Developer Tools.

### 5. Run the App

#### On Android Emulator

If you want to test using an emulator:

1. Install **Android Studio**: [https://developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. During installation, ensure the **Android SDK**, **AVD Manager**, and **HAXM** are checked.
3. Open Android Studio:

   - Go to **More Actions → Virtual Device Manager**.
   - Create a new Android Virtual Device (Pixel 5 or similar, API 33 or higher recommended).
   - Click the **play** ▶️ button to start the emulator.

4. In your terminal (make sure emulator is running):

```bash
npx expo run:android
```

## Troubleshooting issues

If you have certain issues, it might be due to caching from previous build versions. For that just troubleshoot with the following:

- run `npx expo start -c` OR
- run `cd android & ./gradlew clean` (ensure that you have gradle installed)

---

## Create an apk

```bash
npx expo run:android --variant release
```

---

## 🔄 Common Commands

- **Start Expo project with cleared cache**: `npx expo start -c`
- **Start Expo project**: `expo start`
- **Run on Android Emulator**: `expo start --android`
- **Run on iOS Simulator (Mac only)**: `expo start --ios`
- **Build Android APK** (optional): `npx expo build:android`
- **Build iOS app** (Mac + Apple Developer account): `npx expo build:ios`

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Expo Go stuck or blank screen?** → Close and restart Expo Go, clear cache: `expo start -c`
- **Android Emulator not detected?** → Make sure it's started via Android Studio **before** running `expo start --android`.
- **Dependencies missing or breaking?** → Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`, then reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json # or yarn.lock
npm install
```
